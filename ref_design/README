The OpenCL platform model defines the logical representation of all hardware capable of executing an OpenCL program.
The platform is a logical abstraction model for the hardware executing the OpenCL application code. SDAccel projects
are compiled against a target platform. A platform is the combination of board and infrastructure components on which
the kernels of an application will be executed. The refdesign_xilinx_adm-pcie-ku3_2ddr_3_1 is targeted to Kintex
UltraScale KU060 on the Alpha Data ADM-PCIE-KU3 board. Applications compiled for the refdesign_xilinx_adm-pcie-ku3_2ddr_3_1
platform name can only be executed on the Alpha Data ADM-PCIE-KU3 board.

Building the reference design
-----------------------------
From the directory containing this README file extracted from refdesign_xilinx_adm-pcie-ku3_2ddr_3_1.tar.gz:
- Unzip the extracted refdesign_xilinx_adm-pcie-ku3_2ddr_3_1.zip file
- Execute "vivado" from the Vivado installation provided with SDAccel 2016.2
- From Vivado, open the project adm-pcie-ku3_2ddr/adm-pcie-ku3_2ddr.xpr. The filemgmt 56-2 warning can be ignored; it will be corrected by the next step.
- From the Vivado Tcl Console, enter "source run_refdesign.tcl"
- The design will be built and the .dsa output will be created after some time

Hardware bringup tests
----------------------
From the directory containing this README file extracted from refdesign_xilinx_adm-pcie-ku3_2ddr_3_1.tar.gz:
- Create a new working directory, copy the provided bringup_tests_2016_2.tar file to it, and change to that directory
- Extract the provided bringup_tests_2016_2.tar file
- Refer to the extracted lowlevel/README file for further instructions
